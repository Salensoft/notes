* Chap1 Introduction
** what operating systems do
** computer-system organization
   + *device driver* for each device controller
   + *interrupt-request line*
     *interrupt-handler routine*
** computer-system architecture
   + four components
     1. Hardware
        CPU,memory, I/O system
     2. OS
     3. system and application program
     4. user
   + trap ::
     + either an *error* or a *user request*
     +
   + Direct Memory access structure ::
     + without CPU intervention
     + only one interrupt is generated *per block*
   + *multiprocessor* environment must provide *cache coherency* in hardware s.t.
     all CPUs have the most recent value in their cache.
   + *non-uniform memory access*
** operating system structure
   + difference ::
     + different purpose
       1. doesn't guarantee the interactivity, some may not be excute forever.
          system's perspective
       2. from user's perspective
     +
** operating system operations
   I/O devices and the CPU can execute concurrently
   each device controller has a *local buffer*
   I/O is from the device to local buufer of controller
   + *multiprogramming* CPU utilization
     + *job scheduling*
   + *timesharing(multitasking)* interactivity
     + CPU switches jobs so frequently that users can interact with each job
     + *response time* should be <1 seconds
   + interrupt driven by hardware
   + dual-mode ::
     + allows OS to protect itself and other system components
     + *user mode* and *kernel mode*
     + *mode bit*
       + some instructions designated as *privileged*
   +
** process management
   + A _process_ is a program in execution.
   + process needs resources to accomplish its task
   + multi-threaded process has one *program counter* per thread.
** memory management
   + memory management determines what is in memory when
     + optimizing CPU utilization and computer response to users.
   + memory management activities.
     + keeping track of which parts of memory are currently being
       used and by whom
     + deciding which processes and data to move into and out of memory
     + allocating and deallocating memory space
** storage management
