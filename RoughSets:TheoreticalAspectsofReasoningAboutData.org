* Knowledge
** Knowledge base
   Given a finite set $U\neq \emptyset$ (the universe). Any subset $X\subset U$
   of the universe is called a *concept* or a *category* in $U$. And any family of
   concepts in $U$ will be referred to as *abstract knowledge* about $U$.
   
   *partition* or *classification* of a certain universe $U$ is a family 
   $C=\lb X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n$ s.t. $X_i\subset U,X_i\neq\emptyset,X_i\cap
   X_j=\emptyset$ and $\bigcup X_i=U$

   A family of classifications is called a *knowledge base* over $U$


   $R$ an equivalence relation over $U$, $U/R$ family of all equivalence classes
   of $R$, referred to be *categories* or *concepts* of $R$, and $[x]_R$ denotes a
   category in $R$ containing an element $x\in U$

   By a *knowledge base* we can understand a relational system $K=(R,\bR)$, $\bR$
   is a family of equivalence relations over $U$
