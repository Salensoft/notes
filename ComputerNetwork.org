** Broadcast networks
   + broadcast links
   + point-to-point links
   + multicasting
** Internetworks
   + gateways ::
     + make connection and provide translation
   + internetwork: a collection of interconnected networks
   + LAN-WAN-LAN

** protocol hierarchy
   + OSI reference model
     7
     physical(bit) -> data link(frame) -> network(packet) -> transport(回信) -> session(会话层，断点续传)
     -> presentation(表示，统一格式，像int在不同环境里有不同的大小，从统一格式到本地格式) -> application
   + TCP/IP
     host-to-network(data link & physical) -> internet -> transport -> application
   + hybrid model
     physical -> data link -> network -> transport -> application
