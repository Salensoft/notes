* Physical layer
** theoretical basis
*** Bandwidth-limited signals
    + the width of the frequency range transmitted without being strongly attenuated is
      called the *bandwidth*
      a phisical property of the transmission medium
    + usually, for a wire, the amplitudes are transmitted mostly undiminished from 0 up
      to some frequency f_c
    + signals that run from 0 up to a maximum frequency are called *baseband* signals
      Signals taht are shifted to occupy a higher range of frequencies are called
      *passband* signals
*** the maximum data rate of a channel
    + *Nyquist theorem*
      bandwidth = W
      signal rate <= 2W
      levels V
      maximum data rate = 2Blog₂V bits/sec
    + bilevel encoding: Data rate = 2 * Bandwidth (bps)
    + multilevel encoding
      Data rate = 2 * Bandwidth * log₂M (bps)
    + *Shannon's Theorem*
      Bandwidth = H (Hz), Signal-to-noise ratio = S/N
      maximum data rate = H log₂(1 + S/N) (bps)
      Decibels(dB): 10log₁₀(S/N)
      + Example
        Phone wire bandwidth = 3100 Hz
        Decibels = 30 dB
        then 10log₁₀S/N = 30
        log₁₀S/N = 3
        S/N = 1000
        Capacity = 3100log₂(1+1000)
        = 30894 bps
** Digital modulation and multiplexing
   + the process of converting between bits and signals that represent then is called
     *digital modulation*
   + *baseband transmission* common for wire
     *passband transmission* common for wireless and optical channels
   + *multiplexing*: channels are shared by multiple signals
*** Baseband transmission
    Bit stream
    + Non-return to zero: for an optical fiber, the presence of light is either 1 or 0
    NRZ invert
    ★ manchester (Ethernet) signal rate is larger than data rate, need twice bandwidth than NRZ
    bipolar encoding
    + bandwidth efficiency ::
      + the rate at which the signal changes the *symbol rate*
        bit rate = symbol rate * bits/second
    + clock recovery ::
      + receiver must know when one symbol end and the next symbol begins
    + 4B/5B
      data(4B) -> Codeword(5B)
*** Passband transmission
    + we can take a *baseband* signal and shift it up to occupy a *passband*
    + ASK(amplitude shift keying): two different amplitudes are used to represent 0 and 1
    + FSK(frequency shift keying): two or more different tones are used
    + PSK(phase shift keying): the carrier wave is systematically shifted 0 or 180 degrees at
      each symbol period
    + QPSK(quadrature phase shift keying)
    + frequency division multiplexing ::
      + it divides the spectrum into frequency bands with each user having exclusive
        possession of some band in which to send their signal
      + OFDM(orthogonal FDM) the channel bandwidth is divided into many subcarriers
        that independently send data
      + Time division multiplexing
        the users take turns in a round-robin fashion
    + code division multiplexing ::
      + CDMA(CDM access)
      + each bit time is subdivided into m short intervals called *chips*
        each station is assigned a unique m-bit code calle *chip sequence*
        all chip sequence are pairwise *orthogonal*
        $\mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{T}=0,\mathbf{S}\cdot\bar{\mathbf{S}}=-1,\mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{S}=1$
        Use *Walsh codes* to generate
      + to transmit a 1 bit, a station sends its chip sequence
        to transmit a 0 bit, a station sends the negation of its chip sequence
** The public switched telephone network
*** The local loop: modems, ADSL, and fiber
    + *modem*: a device that converts between a stream of digital bits and an analog
      signal that represents the bits
    + ADSL(asymmetric digital subscriber line)
    + fiber to the home
*** Trunks and multiplexing
    + digitizing voice signals
    + the analog signals are digitized in the end office by a device called a *codec*
      it makes 8000 samples per second(125μsec/sample) since Nyquist theorem
    + *PCM* (Pulse code modulation) the uncompressed data rate for a void-grade
      telephone call is thus 8 bits every 125μsec, or 64kbps
    + TDM (time division multiplexing)
      ITU(then CCITT)
      A frame consists of 24×8+1=193bits. 193bits/125μsec = 1.544Mbps
