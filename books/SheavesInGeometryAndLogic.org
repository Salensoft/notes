* Categorical Preliminaries
  A *category* \(\bC\) consists of a collection of *objects*, a collection of
  *morphisms* and four operations; two of these operations associate with each
  morphism \(f\) of \(\bC\) its *domain* \(\dom(f)\) or \(\textd_0(f)\) and its
  *codomain* \(\cod(f)\) or \(\textd_1(f)\), respectively, both of which are objects of
  \(\bC\). The other two operations are operation which associates with each
  object $C$ of \(\bC\) a morphism \(1_C\) (or \(\id_C\)) of \(\bC\) called the
  *identity morphism* of $C$ and an operation of \(\bC\) s.t.
  \(\textd_0(f)=\textd_1(g)\) another morphism \(f\circ g\). These operations
  are required to satisfy the following axioms
  1. \(\textd_0(1_C)=C=\textd_1(1_C)\)
  2. \(\td_0(f\circ g)=\td_0(g),\td_1(f\circ g)=\td_1(f)\)
  3. \(1_D\circ f=f,f\circ 1_C=f\)
  4. \((f\circ g)\circ h=f\circ(g\circ h)\)

     
  In an arbitrary category \(\bC\), a morphism \(f:C\to D\) in \(\bC\) is called
  an *isomorphism* if there exists a morphism \(g:D\to C\) s.t. \(f\circ g=1_D\)
  and \(g\circ f=1_C\). If such a morphism $f$ exists, one says that $C$ is
  isomorphic to $D$ and one writes \(f:C\xrightarrow{\sim}D\) and \(C\cong D\)

  A morphism \(f:C\to D\) is called an *epi(morphism)* if for any object $E$ and
  any two parallel morphisms \(g,h:D\rightrightarrows E\) in \(\bC\), \(gf=hf\)
  implies \(g=h\); one writes \(f:C\twoheadrightarrow D\) to indicate that $f$
  is an epimorphism. Dually, $f:C\to D$ is called a *mono(morphism)* if for any
  object $B$ and any two parallel morphisms \(g,h:B\rrarrow C\) in \(\bC\),
  (fg=fh) implies \(g=h\); in this case, one writes \(f:C\monoarrow D\). Two
  monomorphisms \(f:A\monoarrow D\) and \(g:B\monoarrow D\) with a common
  codomain $D$ are called *equivalent* if there exists an isomorphism
  \(h:A\xrightarrow{\sim}B\) with \(gh=f\). A *subobject* of $D$ is an equivalence
  class of monomorphisms into $D$. The collection \(\Sub_{\bC}(D)\) of
  subobjects of $D$ carries a natural partial order defined by \([f]\le[g]\) iff
  there is an \(h:A\to B\) s.t. \(f=gh\), where \([f]\) and \([g]\) are the
  classes of \(f:A\monoarrow D\) and \(g:B\monoarrow D\)

  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
  A \arrow[r,rightarrowtail,"f"] \arrow[d,"h"] & D\\
  B \arrow[ur,rightarrowtail,"g"']
  \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}

  If \(\bC\) is a category, we sometimes write \(\bC_0\) for its collection of
  objects and \(\bC_1\) for its collection of mophisms. For two objects $C$ and
  $D$, the collection of morphisms with domain $C$ and codomain $D$ is denoted
  by one of the following three symbols

  \begin{equation*}
  \Hom_{\bC}(C,D),\quad\Hom(C,D),\quad\bC(C,D)
  \end{equation*}
