* General Considerations of uncertainty and vagueness
** Modeling ignorance
   Ignorance arises from a restricted reliability of technical devices, from
   partial knowledge, from insufficiencies of observations or from other causes. 

   In the sequel we distinguish between two different types of ignorance:
   *uncertainty* and *vagueness*.  

   Vagueness arises whenever a datum, although its meaning is not in doubt,
   lacks the desired precision. 

   Uncertainty, on the other hand, corresponds to a
   human being's valuation of some datum, reflecting his or her faith or doubt
   in its source. This concept covers those cases in which the actual state of
   affairs or process is not completely determined but where we have to rely on
   some human expert's subjective preferences among the different possibilities.
