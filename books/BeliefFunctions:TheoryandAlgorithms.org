* Introduction
** Belief function theory
    Central to the theory is the notion of evidenceand how different pieces of
    evidence should be combined in order to make inferences 
* Belief FUnction Theory
** Belief Functions
   A /frame of discernment/ \Theta is a finite set of mutually exclusive elements
   in a domain. A /hypothesis/ or /proposition/ is a subset $A\subseteq\Theta$. A
   hypothesis consisting ofonly one element is called a /singleton/

   A /belief function/ $bel$ assigns a belief value to each hypothesis based on
   one or more pieces of evidenc.
   \begin{equation*}
   bel(A)+bel(\bar{A})\le 1,\quad\forall A\subseteq\Theta
   \end{equation*}
*** Mass function
    A /mass function/basic belief assignment/basic probability assignment/ is in
    many respects the most fundamental belief representation and allother
    representations can be easily obtained from a mass function. Formally, a
    mass function $m$ is a mapping $m:\calp(\Theta)\to[0,1]$ s.t.
    \begin{equation*}
    \displaystyle\sum_{A\subseteq\Theta}m(A)=1
    \end{equation*}
    The  value $m(A)$ is the amount of belief strictly committed to hypothesis
    $A$. Such an assignment to a setAimplies ignorance about the belief
    distributionover subsets of $A$.

    A mass function safisfying
    \begin{equation*}
    m(\emptyset)=0
    \end{equation*}
    is called /normalized/
